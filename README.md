# WorldView

WorldView provides an abstraction over OpenLayers with a set of clear & consistent APIs that allows you to perform common usecases with maps. 

### UseCases

1. Displaying a basic map. You can choose between Google, Bing, OSM & so on, basically whatever OpenLayers supports.
2. Showing markers, polygons, lines on the map, with customizable callbacks.
3. Adding interaction to a map with a toolbar which allows you to dynamically add/move markers, polygons, lines etc

worldview.js objects wrap openlayers objects. A corollary would mean, if you aren't able able to perform a case that is not supported natively by worldview.js, worldview.js objects give you access to OpenLayers objects using which you can perform operations that are possible using OpenLayers.
